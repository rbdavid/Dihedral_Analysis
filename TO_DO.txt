# TO DO FILE:
# -- create some function to prepare atom selections for a non-MDAnalysis dihedral selection; allow the user to read in a dihedral; optimally, this dihedral would not be restricted to a single residue; this might be useful for visualizing dihedral angles that are possible collective variables for enhanced sampling methods;
